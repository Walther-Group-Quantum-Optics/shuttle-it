# If you rely on specific conda envs on nanoHUB, you can request one with -u.
# (If unsure, omit -u; nanoHUB provides a default Anaconda.)
# Examples you might see in other tools:  -u anaconda-2024  or  -u anaconda-6
# If your tool needs nothing special, the next line is enough:
exec /usr/bin/invoke_app "$@" \
